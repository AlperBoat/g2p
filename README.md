Grammer 2 Parser
Created to understand the course in my uni about programming languages and compiler design
Has bunch of AI slop, will rewrite all of them

How to run the program?
-Create a grammar and statement file
-Provide their name to the program (has to be in the same directory in the .exe file)
-It will detect if the provided statement is valid or not, according to the grammer.

Any feedback will be appreciated
